## Layout

### Landing page

The landing page doesn't need a top menu. It should feature:

* Semi-big logo
* 1-2 short paragraphs about Cucumber
** Executable specifications
** Workflow image
** Site Navigation section
** Many platforms/frameworks
** IDE support
** i18n
** Companies using Cucumber
* Picture of Cucumber books

I really like http://git-scm.com/

TAGLINE

Are you tired of outdated specification documents and tedious manual testing?

Cucumber is a tool for Executable Specifications. With Cucumber these 
Specifications are written in plain English (or in one of the 40+ other supported languages).
Cucumber executes these specifications and verifies that the software behaves correctly.

Cucumber supports many different programming languages and plays nice with many software frameworks,
other testing tools and build tools.
