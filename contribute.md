[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository on Github, *clone* it and send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) when you have fixed something. 

Please commit each feature/bugfix on a separate branch as this makes it easier for us to decide what to merge and what not to merge.
